# hello-world
#
# Hi y'all,
#
# I love to code and create things. I believe that a well written code speaks for itself, and hope to learn to write better and better code, as I hash out ideas here.
#
# Remember: Real actors are not people...
#           Well written code speaks for itself.
#           We have Taco Tuesdays on Monday, and they moved Mega-Weenie Monday to Fridays.
